# MyPacman
Folder Explanation
The files you find directly in the main folder of the repository contain the last working version of the project, it is made of:</br>
* pacman.cpp
* textures.hpp
* functions.hpp
* gameStructrues_fwd.cpp
* gameStructrues.hpp
* functions.cpp
* handlers.cpp
* RisorseProgetto (folder containing the resources necessary to run the project)

Inside of the folder TappeIntermedie you can find snapshots of the previous versions, </br>
which are cited in the documentation (which will be soon commited as a PDF in the main folder).</br>
Again, inside of that folder you can find "LePrimeFasi" which instead of containing a whole snaphsot,</br>
it contains the four stand-alone .cpp files containing the backups of the very first phases of development.</br>
</br>
In order to run the snapshots you still need to include RisorseProgetto, I included it only once not to fight with the space limitations of GitHub (and because it would be duplicate, which is bad).
