# MyPacman
Folder Explanation:
The files you find directly in the main folder of the repository contain the last working version of the project, it is made of:
* pacman.cpp
* textures.hpp
* functions.hpp
* gameStructrues_fwd.cpp
* gameStructrues.hpp
* functions.cpp
* handlers.cpp
* RisorseProgetto (folder containing the resources necessary to run the project)

Inside of the folder TappeIntermedie you can find snapshots of the previous versions, 
which are cited in the documentation (which will be soon commited as a PDF in the main folder).
Again, inside of that folder you can find "LePrimeFasi" which instead of containing a whole snaphsot,
it contains the four stand-alone .cpp files containing the backups of the very first phases of development.

In order to run the snapshots you still need to include RisorseProgetto, I included it only once not to fight with the space limitations of GitHub (and because it would be duplicate, which is bad).
